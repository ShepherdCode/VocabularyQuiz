iteration	 Executing a sequence of statements repeatedly.
loop	 A statement that executes a sequence of statements repeatedly.
loop body	 The statements inside the loop.
infinite loop	 A loop whose condition is always true.
program development	 A process for writing programs. So far we have seen “incremental development” and “encapsulation and generalization”.
encapsulate	 To wrap a sequence of statements in a method.
generalize	 To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value) with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
loop variable	 A variable that is initialized, tested, and updated in order to control a loop.
increment	 Increase the value of a variable.
decrement	 Decrease the value of a variable.
pretest loop	 A loop that tests the condition before each iteration. 
posttest loop	 A loop that tests the condition after each iteration.
